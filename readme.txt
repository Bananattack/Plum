Plum is a free indie game engine, that will one day be used for making cool 2D games with minimal effort and maximum awesome through Lua scripting, a mixture of software and hardware rendering, and a well designed map strucutre.

It is very WIP still. As in, still in the planning stages. But it is slowly making strides.
